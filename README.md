# Lispy (wip!)

A **Howl** bundle with some commands similar to **ParEdit**
for languages with **S**-expressions(Lisp-like).

The bundle provides these commands prefixed with *sexp-* which can
be bound to shortcuts in `~/.howl/init.lua`:

- select
- delete
- slurp
- barf
- kill
- split
- previous
- next
